Wanted to convert this story into a book-like format for a very long time -- ever since I read it, actually.  Many thanks to Lightning-on-the-Wave for writing this story. 

I've done a little cleanup on scene separators (originals were a string of "SSSSS", replaced with horizontal lines), cleaned up typos and some extra words here and there, and removed some author warnings (due to this being a *book* format, instead of a series of livejournal / fanfiction.net postings).

To build PDFs run the following:
```
latexmk -cd -e -f -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode -synctex=1 <FILE>
```

Followed by:
```
latexmk -C
```
to clean up ancillary files.
